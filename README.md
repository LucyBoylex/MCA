# Music Curation and Analytics 2018

This is a simple template for publishing MEI with Verovio for the Music Curation and Analytics Course at the University of Glasgow.

Week 1:

This week we have been exploring some of the datasets that are used by music researchers. As we have seen, these datasets can consist of notated, acoustic, or descriptive data. The individual lab activities over the next 10 weeks will be geared to helping you build and curate your own musical dataset. This dataset will consist of all three of these data types, and you will submit it as the ‘Dataset’ portion your final project. To complete this week’s activity, you will need to accomplish the following two tasks: 

1.	Identify a theme for your dataset. This will be the central, cohesive strand that will bring your data together. It can be an artist, composer, songwriter, performer, album, larger work (i.e. opera, musical, etc.), time period, genre, archival grouping, etc. You will want to be sure that you can gather all three types of data based on your selected theme. 

I will look at the work of Swedish pop band Abba.

2.	Describe the current manifestations of data relating to your selected theme. Has it already been curated somewhere? How is the data presented, described, and analysed? Create a Word document with your responses to this information. Eventually you will use it as a readme file or general description of your dataset.

The work of Abba has been widely curated and stored. It can be found in notated, descriptive and acoustic formats easily online. If we look at Apple Music for example, we can see it holds acoustic and descriptive data on the music it has. Descriptive data being the way the music is displayed on screen, showing the artist, song, duration, album, producer etc etc. Acoustic data being the actual sound file and the way we hear the songs played. Apple music does not, as far as I can see, hold any notated data.
However notated data is easy to find online for the works of Abba. Looking at sheetsdaily.com we are able to find scores of Abba music for several instruments and songs.
